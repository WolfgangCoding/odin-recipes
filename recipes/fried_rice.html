                <li>3 teaspoons vegtable oil</li>
                <li>.25 pounds bacon</li>
                <li>.125 cup soy sauce</li>

            <ol>
                <li>In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, season eggs with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 teaspoon oil in small frying pan, pour in eggs. Coat the bottom of the pan with the eggs, in order to cook them evenly; cook for about 3 minutes.

                <li>Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.</li>
                <li>Spoon remaining 2 teaspoons oil into the skillet with the bacon fat. Stir in rice; break up any clumps and toss to coat with oil. Stir in bacon, soy sauce, peas, eggs and green onions. Stir and cook until heated through, approximately 3 minutes.</li>
